2. Open browser to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
3. Use the search box to find items by:
   - **SKU**: Type exact code like "LV01"
   - **Product Name**: Type keywords like "wallet" or "bag"
   - **Brand Filter**: Select brand from dropdown

#### **Common Search Scenarios**
- Customer asks about SKU "CH123" ‚Üí Type "CH123" in search box

### For Inventory Managers

#### **Command Line (More Powerful)**
```bash
# Open terminal and navigate to system folder
cd /Users/yujunchen/Documents/goose/inventory_system

# Start interactive mode
python3 search_cli.py

# In interactive mode, use these commands:
sku LV01              # Find specific SKU

exit                 # Quit
```

## üìã What Information You'll See

For each item, the system shows:
- **SKU**: Unique product code
- **Product Name**: Full item description

- **Status**: AVAILABLE or SOLD
- **Sold Date**: When it was sold (if applicable)

## üîç Search Tips

### Best Practices
1. **For exact matches**: Use the complete SKU
2. **For browsing**: Use keywords like "wallet", "bag", "clutch"
3. **For brand search**: Use the brand filter or type brand name
4. **Case doesn't matter**: "lv01" works the same as "LV01"

### Search Examples
| What Customer Wants | How to Search |
|-------------------|---------------|
| "Do you have SKU LV01?" | Type: `LV01` |
| "Any Chanel wallets?" | Type: `wallet` + Brand: `Chanel` |
| "What Gucci bags do you have?" | Brand: `Gucci` |
| "Any black bags?" | Type: `black` |
| "Items under $500?" | Search then filter results manually |
